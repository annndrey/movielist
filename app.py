    A full list of movies is available at /movies
    Actors list can be reaced by hitting the /actors URL

    It can be turned on by providing additional argument ?page=NUM_PAGE to the URL, 
    especially for the movies list.

    If you decide to add a new entry to our collection, pick a list of authors & genres,
    provide a movie ttitle and release year and just send us a POST request to /movies with
    all your data in JSON format. The following fields  are required: year, title, 
    cast[list], genres[list]. If everything is OK, you'll see your new entry together with it's ID.
    
    To edit an already added entry, please sent the PATCH request to the /movies/[MOVIE_ID] endpoint

    If for some reason you've decided to delete a movie from the collection, send the DELETE 
    request to /movies/[MOVIE_ID
